# Project Name
> Determining the Rental Bike Demand for Boom Bike, a US bike provider which makes shared use of bikes available


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]The company BoopBikes have recently faced a dip in revenues due to Corona Pandemic and wantes to  understand the demand  of bikes post the pandemic. Developing a Machine Learning Model to understand which variables are significant in predicting the demans for shared bikes and how well are they helping the model to determine/predict the demand.
* [Technologies Used] Python
* [Conclusions] Variables such as Experienced temperature, season, weekdays etc comes to be important variables with a model R2 score of approximately 85%.
